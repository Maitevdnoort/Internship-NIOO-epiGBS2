# Rscripts_barcodes
Here are all the scripts making ggplots about the reatained reads (barcodes)
## - Retained_reads_numbers_lollipop.R
- Author: Maite van den Noort
- Date: 08-11-2020, last modified: 20-01-2021
- Function: makes a lollipop plot with the number of retained reads for both libraries
## - Retained_barcodes_samplenames.R
- Author: Maite van den Noort
- Date: 30-12-2020
- Function: This script makes ggplots about the retained reads per sample
## - Retained_barcodes_lollipop.R
- Author: Maite van den Noort
- Date: 07-01-2021
- Function: This script makes a lollipop plot about the retained reads. Watson and crick are here together.  
The samplenames are on y-as with the two librarys in the plot.
